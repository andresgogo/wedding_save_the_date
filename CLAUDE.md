# Wedding Save the Date Website Project

## Project Goals
> "I would like to start a project to create and host a simple website. The website will be used for my wedding's 'save the date' where we will send people a link to our 'wedding's website' so they can know where and when and what the general plan of the wedding is. I am an experienced backend engineer but i have little wed development/frontend development experience. HTML i dont know much about or how styling works or anything like that. I would like this project to both be practical and also a learning experience. Therefore, please help me create the website but stop at different points to help me look at how web development works. I would like to have many chances where we stop and i am able to load the website to see what is changing."

## User Background
- Experienced backend engineer
- Limited web development/frontend experience
- Minimal HTML knowledge
- Limited styling knowledge
- Familiar with Python
- Limited JavaScript experience
- Wants learning opportunities with frequent check-ins

## Development Approach
- Build incrementally with frequent stops to review changes
- Focus on learning web development concepts
- Load website frequently to see visual progress
- Explain concepts as we go

## Language & Framework Selection

### Options to Consider:
1. **Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript** - Most fundamental learning experience
2. **Python + Flask** - Leverages existing Python knowledge
3. **JavaScript + Simple Framework** (like vanilla JS with minimal tooling)
4. **Modern JS Framework** (React, Vue, etc.) - Industry standard but steeper learning curve

### Recommendation: TBD
We'll discuss and decide based on learning goals vs. practicality.
