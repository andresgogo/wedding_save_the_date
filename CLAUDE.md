# Wedding Save the Date Website Project

## Project Goals
> "I would like to start a project to create and host a simple website. The website will be used for my wedding's 'save the date' where we will send people a link to our 'wedding's website' so they can know where and when and what the general plan of the wedding is. I am an experienced backend engineer but i have little wed development/frontend development experience. HTML i dont know much about or how styling works or anything like that. I would like this project to both be practical and also a learning experience. Therefore, please help me create the website but stop at different points to help me look at how web development works. I would like to have many chances where we stop and i am able to load the website to see what is changing."

## User Background
- Experienced backend engineer
- Limited web development/frontend experience
- Minimal HTML knowledge
- Limited styling knowledge
- Familiar with Python
- Limited JavaScript experience
- Wants learning opportunities with frequent check-ins

## Development Approach
- Build incrementally with frequent stops to review changes
- Focus on learning web development concepts
- Load website frequently to see visual progress
- Explain concepts as we go

## Language & Framework Selection

### Options to Consider:
1. **Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript** - Most fundamental learning experience
2. **Python + Flask** - Leverages existing Python knowledge
3. **JavaScript + Simple Framework** (like vanilla JS with minimal tooling)
4. **Modern JS Framework** (React, Vue, etc.) - Industry standard but steeper learning curve

### Chosen: Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **HTML** - Structure and content
- **CSS** - Styling and layout  
- **JavaScript** - Interactivity (minimal for this project)
- No build tools initially - just open files directly in browser
- Can add simple Python server later for local development

## Repository
- GitHub: https://github.com/andresgogo/wedding_save_the_date.git

## Website Content Requirements
- Wedding date and time
- Location information
- General wedding plan/schedule
- Contact information (optional)
- RSVP mechanism (future consideration)
- Pictures of dog
- Wedding-specific styling and themes

## Development Commands
- **View locally**: Open `index.html` directly in browser
- **Simple server**: `python3 -m http.server 8000` (then visit http://localhost:8000)
- **Deploy**: GitHub Pages (will set up later)

## Notes
- Prioritize learning over speed
- Stop frequently to review and understand changes
- Focus on practical, working website
